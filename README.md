# Code-Quiz

This is a code quiz that provides five multiple choice questions about JavaScript. The player starts off with 60 seconds on the clock. If they answer a question wrong, 5 seconds is subtracted from the timer. If the player successfully answers all 5 questions correctly within the allotted time, they are asked if they would like to save their score. If they answer yes, they are asked to provide their initials and the time that they got. If the player then clicks on View Most Recent Score, they are presented with their most recent score. If the timer runs out, the player is asked if they would like to play again.
